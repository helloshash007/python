Technical Write-Up: Python Script for File Processing and Data Extraction

1. Introduction

This Python script is designed to perform various file processing and data extraction tasks. It combines several operations and functionalities, including command-line argument parsing, reading and processing text files, searching for specific records, file management, and execution of subprocesses. This write-up provides an overview of the script's structure and functions.

2. Script Structure

The script is organized into the following sections:

2.1. Import Statements

The script begins with importing necessary modules, such as os, argparse, json, and others. These modules provide essential functionalities for different tasks.
2.2. Logging Configuration

Logging is configured to record messages in a log file named "combined_script.log." This allows for tracking the script's execution and any issues that may arise.
2.3. Thread Safety

To ensure thread safety when writing log messages, a lock is created using the threading module. This prevents concurrent writes to the log file by multiple threads.
2.4. Command Line Argument Parsing

The argparse module is employed to parse command-line arguments. These arguments include the file to be processed, a file path, an account number, and a currency code. These arguments are used in subsequent sections.
2.5. File Existence Check

The script checks if a specified customer file exists at the provided path. This ensures that the required input file is present.
2.6. Read and Process File

The specified file is read line by line, and relevant information is extracted, including an account number and currency details. These details are logged for reference.
2.7. Write Results

The extracted account number and currency information are written to a file named "results.txt." This facilitates easy access to the extracted data.
2.8. Record Search and Processing

A series of functions are defined to read, process, and search for specific records within a data file. The results of the search are logged.
2.9. Further Processing Based on Search Results

Depending on the search results, different actions are taken. These actions include executing subprocesses, moving files, and logging messages to indicate success or failure.
2.10. Second Script Section

The script continues with a section that involves copying and moving files, simulating sleep periods, and creating ".ok" files to mark file processing completion.
2.11. Final Message

The script concludes with a log message indicating that the maximum number of trials has been reached. This provides closure to the execution process.
3. Conclusion

This Python script combines a series of operations, including file handling, data extraction, and file management, to process specific files and execute tasks based on the extracted data. It's important to note that the script relies on external files, such as "execution.sh," and assumes a specific file structure and data format. Additionally, the script uses logging to capture information about its execution.

Before running the script, ensure that all required external files and dependencies are in place and that the command-line arguments are correctly provided.

Note: For this technical write-up, we assume that the script's functionalities align with your intended use case, and the code snippets have been corrected to address syntax issues. Further adjustments may be required to fit the specific requirements of your project or system.
